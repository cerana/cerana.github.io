  "body": "# What Is Cerana?\r\nCerana is a lightweight, opinionated system for deploying cloud infrastructure. It combines a purpose built Linux distribution with Go based server orchestration tools.\r\n\r\n# How Does Cerana Work?\r\nCerana uses a custom Linux distribution built with cloud operability in mind. With CeranaOS you get a ZFS filesystem, KVM and Docker compatible lightweight containers, ktap for system analysis, and systemd for more programmable management.\r\n\r\nTo complete the system, we have API based orchestration to manage VMs within your cloud. Our Go based services include clustered support that automagically keeps track of new hardware as you grow your cloud infrastructure.\r\n\r\nFor more information, be sure to check out our [documentation](https://github.com/cerana/cerana/tree/master/docs) and [the CeranaOS repo](https://github.com/cerana/cerana-os).\r\n\r\n# Who Is Behind Cerana?\r\nCerana is primarily developed by engineers at [OmniTI](http://omniti.com/), with contributions from various members of the open source community. If you are into Linux kernel hacking and want to improve the state of Linux containers or ZFS on Linux, [OmniTI is hiring.](http://omniti.com/is/hiring)\r\n\r\n# Stay Involved\r\nAs a new open source project, we welcome contributors from all areas; OS hackers, Go devs, documentation folks, website help; all are welcome! If you are interested in testing out Cerana, please join us on freenode on [#cerana](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=cerana).",
