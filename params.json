  "body": "# What Is Cerana?\r\nCerana makes using a cluster of computing nodes for any task quick and efficient. It combines a purpose built Linux distribution with Go based server orchestration tools.\r\n\r\n# How Does Cerana Work?\r\nCerana uses a custom Linux distribution built with clustered computing in mind. With CeranaOS you get delegatable ZFS filesystems, secure contained processes with network isolation, and efficient virtualization.\r\n\r\nTo complete the system, we have API based orchestration to manage datasets and processes within your cluster. Our Go based services include clustered support that automagically uses your infrastructure efficiently as it grows.\r\n\r\nFor more information, be sure to check out our [documentation](https://github.com/cerana/cerana/tree/master/docs).\r\n\r\n# Who Is Behind Cerana?\r\nCerana is primarily developed by engineers at [OmniTI](http://omniti.com/), with contributions from various members of the open source community. If you are into Linux kernel hacking and want to improve the state of Linux containers or ZFS on Linux, [OmniTI is hiring.](http://omniti.com/is/hiring)\r\n\r\n# Stay Involved\r\nAs a new open source project, we welcome contributors from all areas; OS hackers, Go devs, documentation folks, website help; all are welcome! If you are interested in testing out Cerana, please join us on freenode on [#cerana](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=cerana).",
